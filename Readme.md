# Pathway Analysis Tool

This R script performs a pathway analysis using gene symbols as input to query the pathDIP database. It outputs the pathways associated with the given gene symbols.

## Requirements

- R Programming Language (version 4.0.0 or higher)
- R packages: httr, jsonlite

## Installation

Before running the script, ensure you have R installed on your system. You can download R from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).

Install the required R packages using the following commands in the R console:

```R
install.packages("httr")
install.packages("jsonlite")
```

## Usage

To use the script, run it from the command line with Rscript, followed by the script name and a comma-separated list of gene symbols.

```bash
Rscript Pathway.R "GENE1,GENE2,GENE3"
```

### Help

To display the help message and usage instructions, use the `-h` or `--help` flag:

```bash
Rscript Pathway.R -h
```

## Inputs

The script accepts a single input: a string of comma-separated gene symbols with no spaces. For example:

```bash
"ATF2,FOS,JUN,MAPK1"
```

Ensure the gene symbols are valid and recognized by the pathDIP database.

## Outputs

The script outputs the results directly to the console. If pathways associated with the input gene symbols are found, it will list them in a formatted output. If no pathways are found, a message indicating this will be displayed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors, ensure that you have an active internet connection, as the script requires access to the pathDIP database. Additionally, verify that the gene symbols are correctly formatted and valid.

For any other issues, refer to the error messages outputted by the script, which should guide you to the source of the problem.
